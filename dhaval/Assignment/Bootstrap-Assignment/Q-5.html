    <h1>Q-5 What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5</h1>

    <p>Ans: Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 are two major versions of the Bootstrap front-end framework, with Bootstrap 5
        being the more recent release.</p>
    <p> Bootstrap 4 relies on jQuery for some of its JavaScript components and functionalities. In contrast, Bootstrap 5
        has removed the jQuery dependency entirely, making it lighter and more modern.</p>
    <p> Bootstrap 5 introduces several new components and features that were not available in Bootstrap 4.</p>

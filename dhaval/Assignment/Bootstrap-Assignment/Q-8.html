    <h1>Q-8 In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h1>

    <p>Ans:  In Bootstrap 4, flexbox refers to the Flexbox layout module, which is a CSS layout model that provides a more efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.</p>

    <p> Any element that has its display property set to flex or inline-flex becomes a flex container.</p>

    <p>The children of a flex container are called flex items.  <br><br>These items can be arranged horizontally or vertically, and their size can be adjusted based on available space and content.</p>
    
    <p> Flex containers can have their flex direction set to row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse, which determines the direction in which flex items are laid out along the main axis.</p>

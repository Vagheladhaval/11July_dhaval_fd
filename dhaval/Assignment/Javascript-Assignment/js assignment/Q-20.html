    <h1>What is the differance between && and || in javascript?</h1>

    <p>&& : <br><br>
        The logical AND operator (&&) returns true if both operands are true. If either operand is false, it returns
        false. It also performs short-circuit evaluation, meaning it evaluates the second operand only if the first one
        is true.</p>
    <p>|| : <br><br>
        The logical OR operator (||) returns true if at least one of the operands is true. If both operands are false,
        it returns false. It also performs short-circuit evaluation, meaning it evaluates the second operand only if the
        first one is false.</p>

        let x = 5;
        console.log(x > 3 && x < 10);



        let m = false;
        let d = true;
        console.log(a || b);

        let t = 5;
        console.log(x > 3 || x < 2);

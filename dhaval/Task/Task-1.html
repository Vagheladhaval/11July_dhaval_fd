    <h2> The Time line of HTML</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>1991</b>- Tim Berners-Lee invents HTML 1.0</li>
        <li><b>1993</b>- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are creating websites at this time.</li>
        <li><b>1995</b>- HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the features of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.</li>
        <li><b>1997</b>- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites. Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</li>
        <li><b>1999</b>- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful.</li>
        <li><b>2014</b>- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.
